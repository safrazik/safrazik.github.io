It was a complete joy working with him, and I recommend him wholeheartedly. He is very bright and very talented - but the best part is his attitude. As he himself says, **"Consider it done"**. I am myself a programmer. I hired him to take load off me - and he did!

At one point it turned out my spec perhaps wasn't as clear as could be, and he implemented something a little different. I pointed it out to him, and explained what I meant, and he just reimplemented that part, to spec.

His work **exceeded** my expectations AND he provided me with clear instructions with how to integrate his work with my own.

I have the utmost respect for him, and I'm grateful for his professionalism.

Truly a gem.
